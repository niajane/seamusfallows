## Research Experience

### AI Safety Hubs Labs Summer Research Project <time> July 2023 - Oct 2023 </time>

– Worked in a team of four investigating Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS), a recently-developed
unsupervised technique for extracting knowledge from the hidden activations of pretrained LLMs.
– This involved re-implementing CCS for a range of models and datasets using Hugging Face’s Transformers library.
– Resulted in a paper Comparing Optimization Targets for Contrast-Consistent Search, accepted to the ‘Socially Responsible Language Modelling Research’ (SoLaR) conference.

### PhD <time> Oct 2018 - Dec 2022 </time>

– Conducted original research in the areas of holography, quantum gravity, and black holes, resulting in
three published papers.
– Attended several high energy physics conferences and summer schools and have given two talks on my research.
